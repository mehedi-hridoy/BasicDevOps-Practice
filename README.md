# DevOps Practice Projects

This repository contains small exercises and experiments for practicing DevOps skills: automation, CI/CD, containerization, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and related tooling.

## Contents

- A set of standalone experiments and example configurations (scripts, manifests, Dockerfiles, CI pipelines).
- Notes and short guides documenting what each experiment demonstrates and how to run it locally.

> Note: This is a personal practice repository. The contents change frequently as experiments are added and iterated.

## Goals


## CI/CD

A minimal GitHub Actions workflow exists at `.github/workflows/read-hello-file.yml`. It triggers on pushes to `main` and runs a job that prints the contents of `hello.txt`.
